## Reflection Document

I didn't realize we were supposed to try the labs without the videos so I did
all of them following along with the videos.

### HTML

Section 1:
Section 1 was a nice intro to web development and HTML, since I have no previous
experience. It is nice to go back and look at things like accessibility and validity now that
I understand more about proper development practices. I think this section was
adequate for introductory purposes.

Section 2:
Section 2 was a good introduction to the important concept of accessibility in
web development.

Section 3:
Section 3 was a very fun section because it introduced using CSS as a style technique.
I think there was an adequate amount of exercises that spanned a good amount
of introductory CSS and introduced different concepts of responsiveness
and styling.

Section 4:
I enjoyed learning about flexbox and how powerful it is although I may have implemented
it incorrectly in one of the homeworks where I should have used an HTML table.

Section 5:
Section 5 was another fun learning experience for implementing new topics and also
putting CSS skills to new use.

Section 6:
Section 6 was useful because it introduced Bootstrap, which is widely used
around the Web today.

Section 7:
Section 7 was exciting because we finally got to work with Javascript, which has
dominated web development since it was developed. Javascript is very
powerful, especially for web developers. It uses concepts and paradigms
much more akin to the programming languages like C++ that we've already
learned. It also introduces concepts like synchronous vs
asynchronous programming.

Section 8:
Section 8 introduces jQuery, which is used by the majority of the most
popular websites today. We didn't focus on jQuery too much, but I
think it helps with asynchronous programming and modern web networking.
It is nice to learn a bit about jQuery to see where web development
is headed in the future.

### Accessibility

I learned a lot about accessibility and how important it is in web development.
People of all kinds and abilities use the internet, and it is crucial to design
websites that are available and easy to use for everyone.
